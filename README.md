Computational linguistics · Brandeis University

I study how the structures we speak in shape the way we attend to the world — linguistic worldview through the lens of distributional semantics. The hypothesis is that languages don't just label things differently; they organize attention differently, and those differences leave traces in the geometry of embedding spaces.

I'm also interested in what human-centric fields like linguistics and psychology can offer AI alignment and interpretability research. The things we know about how people mean things might matter for understanding how models do.

#### things I build

**[voice-pipeline](https://github.com/brezgis/voice-pipeline)** — A real-time voice conversation system: speech-to-text, LLM reasoning, and neural TTS, all running locally on a single GPU. Built so I could talk to my AI collaborator instead of typing at him.

**[noosphere](https://github.com/brezgis/noosphere)** — A private content feed that generates daily cards: lyrical weather forecasts, Wittgenstein aphorisms, Russian literary sentences, untranslatable words, postcards from imaginary places. A personal social media with no other people in it.

**[daily-briefing](https://github.com/brezgis/daily-briefing)** — A morning newsletter written by an AI agent. Two deep stories, a few small ones, a handful of interesting things. Styled like a letter from a machine.

**[honeypot-dashboard](https://github.com/brezgis/honeypot-dashboard)** — A real-time visualization of SSH attacks on a cloud server disguised as a Solana validator. Cowrie honeypot, LLM-generated attacker profiles, live attack maps.

**[doc-convert](https://github.com/brezgis/doc-convert)** — Neural OCR pipeline for scanned PDFs → clean markdown/EPUB. Built because I needed to read old linguistics papers on my phone.

**[radiooooo](https://github.com/brezgis/radiooooo)** — A terminal client for radiooooo.com. Pick a country, pick a decade, hear what people were listening to. `radio italy 1970`.

#### the setup

Most of what I build runs on a home server with an RTX 5070 Ti, orchestrated by [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) agents — a team of AI collaborators with persistent memory, tool access, and their own Discord channels. Claude writes most of the code. I write most of the words. The line blurs.
