### Anna Brežġis · Анна Брежгис

Computational linguistics at Brandeis. I study how languages organize attention differently, and what traces that leaves in embedding spaces.

Most of what I build runs on a home server, orchestrated by [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) agents. Claude writes most of the code. I write most of the words. The line blurs.
